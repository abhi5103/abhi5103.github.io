                <h2>1.RAFTING</h2>
                <p>Rafting and whitewater rafting are recreational outdoor activities which use an inflatable raft to navigate a river or other body of water.<br>This is often done on whitewater or different degrees of rough water. Dealing with risk is often a part of the experience.This activity as<br> an adventure sport has become popular since the 1950s, if not earlier, evolving from individuals paddling 10 feet (3.0 m) to 14 feet <br>(4.3 m) rafts with double-bladed paddles or oars to multi-person rafts propelled by single-bladed paddles and steered by a person at the <br>stern, or by the use of oars. </p>
